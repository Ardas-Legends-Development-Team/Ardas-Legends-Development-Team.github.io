title: Expansion Rules
---

When building or editing claimbuilds we have some rules, that have to be followed in order for the claimbuild to be accepted in general.
- Any NPC structure or a structure looking like one will not be considered as part of the claimbuild.
- Effort is key, realism is taken into account.
- Claimbuilds must have a distance of at least **300 blocks** between them (unless the build is part of another - stronghold in a capital for example), and with lorebuilds and waypoints.
- Fulfilling all requirements guarantees your build is accepted, however, requirements can be skipped. Requirements that are missing on purpose have to be mentioned in the application, together with a justification. Staff judges the effort to replace the missing requirements and has the final say in whether or not the absence of the requirement is acceptable. *Effort is part of the requirements.*
- Rushed builds of any kind will not be accepted. Rushing includes, but is not limited too small or cramped houses, no lighting, weird block choices for buildings like dirt, no armour or weapons on racks, cube buildings with flat roofs (there are obviously some exceptions for certain factions), walls that provide no actual protection unless on a large body of water, or schematic printing errors with things like slabs or trapdoors.
- All claimbuild components have to be connected by [roads](/docs/_residentialClaimbuildComponents/roads.md)
- When upgrading a build from one tier to the next, a flat construction cost of 3k coins must be paid for it to be accepted. When expanding a build with any additions, a cost of 1k coins must be paid for it to be accepted.
- Claimbuilds that are nearly identical or resemble each other too much are considered lacking effort and thus will not be accepted.
- Decorative Element is a term that we use frequently in this. Its definition is any sort of block or ornament that can be placed to help make the area/building look lively and actually used. The following are examples, BUT are not limited to: Banners, Paintings, Flowers, Weapon racks, Armour stands with armour, etc.
- If a food production site is used to produce non-food resources (e.g. cow slaughterhouse used to produce leather rather than food, or a flax farm), then it does not satisfy the food production site requirement.
- Staff has the right to unaccept claimbuilds in the event major faults are discovered. In such a scenario, the original builder has 2 weeks to rectify the problems. If no significant effort is made by the original builder in these 2 weeks, the owning faction has 2 weeks to fix the points brought to attention by staff, but nothing else, whilst keeping as true as possible to the original building style. If it isn’t fixed after 4 weeks have passed, the build is unaccepted.
- Builds submitted under older versions of the Builders Bible do not have to be updated, unless a specific request is made by staff. A resubmitted build will have to follow the most up-to-date rules, regardless of the version of the Builders Bible it was originally submitted under.
- Should you capture a build and wish to edit it, please provide staff with proof that the original builder has agreed to allow you to edit the build.
- In order to claim a region with a claimbuild, the region needs to either be adjecent to a region owned by your faction or you´ll need a trading camp build and accepted in the region you wish to claim
