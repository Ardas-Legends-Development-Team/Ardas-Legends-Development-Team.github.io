title: Claimbuilds
---

Claimbuilds are the base of the Arda´s Legends System and can be used to claim uncontested regions, aquire resources, rally armies and generally being creative when building.
Once a claimbuild has been approved by staff it is no longer owned by the builder, but by the faction it has been applied for.
When it comes to claimbuilds, there are 3 types of claimbuilds that can be generally noted: Civilian Claimbuilds, Military Claimbuilds and Camps. The different types of claimbuilds are explained in [claimbuild types](docs/Claimbuilds/claimbuildTypes.md).
Each of those claimbuilds consists of different components, that in their entirety form the claimbuild itself, for more information on those components check [claimbuild components](docs/Claimbuilds/claimbuildComponents.md).
The requirements you will find for the different components and claimbuilds are used by staff to judge a claimbuild that has been applied, while also effort and realism is looked for.
We also wish to promote creativity so if you have a creative idea how something could be done different from the requirements, feel free to do it. If you are unsure if it would be accepted you can always ask for feedback from staff. Certain things however cannot be altered from the requirements in order to keep the integrety of the war system.
If you aren´t a creative builder following the requirements and putting in a bit of effort will help your build getting accepted.

Before you start building a claimbuild take a look at the [expansion rules](docs/Claimbuilds/expansionRules.md) as a claimbuild will be denied without hesitation if those aren´t met.
