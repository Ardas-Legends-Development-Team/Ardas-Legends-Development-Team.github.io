Traps are an optional way to help you defend your claimbuild.
## Requirements
- All traps must leave a player at a minimum of 50% HP in one usage. Multi use traps like arrow traps or fire are not considered single use.
- Displacement traps must allow for someone to escape. The affected player may not be pushed into an inescapable pit for example. Parkour escapes must be very easy.
- How many traps a build can have can be found in the notes. If it isn’t mentioned none are allowed.

## Notes
- Arrow slits and moats do not count as traps. Moats must not be unavoidable or, if filled with lava, must not have walkways that force players to be easily knocked into the lava.
- Cobwebs/morgul flowers/elven rope are all considered traps.
- Redstone may be used in traps.
- Traps are required to be reviewed by all staff. Please state all traps in your application.
- Unavoidable traps are okay provided that it does not lead to someone’s instant death or forces them to be stuck.
