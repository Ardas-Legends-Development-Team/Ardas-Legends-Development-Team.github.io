An unroofed area that is surrounded by walls. This could be for training exercises, decoration, a meeting place, or mustering.

## Requirements
- Unroofed area, surrounded by walls.
- Showcases a “use” (training ground, gardens or decoration, a meeting area, etc.).

## Notes
-Can be between the outer wall and the inner wall or the inner wall and the inner keep but must be fully surrounded by walls.
- An inner keep does not satisfy the use requirement.
- Can be underground but must clearly have the same spirit.
