name: Gate
---

Gates are part of any wall you build.

## Requirements
- Minimum size of 3x3
- The road leading up to the gate has to be 5 wide for a minimum of 5 blocks from the gate.
- Cannot be walked over or around or easily jumped over on foot.

## Notes
- Gate health does not increase above 9X9 sizes. Width and height are independent in this regard; e.g. an 8X10 gate is measured as 8X9 when it comes to the gate health.
- A gate following another gate with no defensive features between them is not functional and will be opened when the first gate falls.
- Gates smaller than 3X3 (either of the dimensions) is considered a door and can be opened by anyone. 
- Gates in hamlets and villages can be opened by anyone.

### Gate Health
The health of a gate is based upon the gates material. For mixed gates, we take the gate type that more are used from.
