- 8 tents
- 1 large tent
- 3 transport carts
- 1 forge tent
- the siege equipment carried by the army
- must be build within line of sight of the attacked claimbuild
- may not be to close to the attacked claimbuild

## Benefits
- Allows an army to siege a claimbuild with a wall
- provides a commander of the sieging faction
- provides a smith at the forge tent
- provides a military spawner

## Notes
- War camps are required for all builds with walls regardless of if the faction has players or not.
- Remember that terrain impacts what siege can be used: donâ€™t waste your time building siege towers or trebuchets in mountains or swamps.
- The war camp is not subjected to the rule where the distance between claimbuilds has to be 300 blocks or more
